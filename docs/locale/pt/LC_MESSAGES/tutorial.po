msgid ""
"**What is AMR?** Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria evolve to "
"survive treatments that previously killed them. It's like bacteria "
"developing \"armor\" against antibiotics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:64
msgid ""
"**Why does it matter?** When bacteria become resistant, common infections"
" become harder to treat, leading to: - Longer hospital stays - Higher "
"treatment costs - Increased risk of complications - Sometimes death from "
"previously treatable infections"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:71
msgid ""
"**How do bacteria become resistant?** - **Genetic mutations**: Random "
"changes in bacterial DNA - **Gene acquisition**: Bacteria can share "
"resistance genes with each other - **Selection pressure**: Overuse/misuse"
" of antibiotics favors resistant strains"
msgstr ""

msgid "Understanding Bacterial Genomes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:81
msgid ""
"**What is a genome?** A genome is the complete set of genetic "
"instructions for an organism - like a blueprint. For bacteria, this "
"blueprint determines their characteristics, including resistance to "
"antibiotics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:84
msgid ""
"**What is genome sequencing?** Genome sequencing is like reading the "
"bacterial blueprint to understand: - What species/strain the bacteria is "
"- Which resistance genes it carries - How it relates to other bacterial "
"samples"

"**Strains/Genotypes**: Variants within a species with similar genetic "
