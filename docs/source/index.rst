Welcome to AMRnet User Guide!
===================================
The **AMRnet** dashboard aims to make high-quality, robust and reliable genome-derived AMR surveillance data accessible to a wide audience. Visualizations are geared towards showing national annual AMR prevalence estimates and trends, that can be broken down and explored in terms of underlying genotypes and resistance mechanisms. We do not generate sequence data, but we hope that by making publicly deposited data more accessible and useful, we can encourage and motivate more sequencing and data sharing.

We started with Salmonella Typhi, built on our `TyphiNET <https://www.typhi.net>`_ dashboard which uses data curated by the `Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium <http://typhoidgenomics.org>`_ (to improve data quality and identify which datasets are suitable for inclusion) and analysed in `Pathogenwatch <http://pathogen.watch>`_ (to call AMR determinants and lineages from sequence data). More organisms will be added throughout 2024-25, using data sourced from analysis platforms such as `Pathogenwatch <http://pathogen.watch>`_, `Enterobase <https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_, and potentially others. 

A major barrier to using public data for surveillance is the need for careful data curation, to identify which datasets are relevant for inclusion in pooled estimates of AMR and genotype prevalence. This kind of curation can benefit a wide range of users and we plan to work with other organism communities to curate data, and to contribute to wider efforts around metadata standards.

The dashboard code is open access and available in `GitHub <https://github.com/amrnet/amrnet>`_. Issues and feature requests can be posted `here <https://github.com/amrnet/amrnet/issues>`_. An API is coming soon!
