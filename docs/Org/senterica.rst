Nontyphoidal *Salmonella*
=========================


.. container:: justify-text

   Nontyphoidal *Salmonella* data in AMRnet are drawn from `Enterobase <https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_, which calls AMR genotypes using NCBIâ€™s `AMRFinderPlus <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/>`_, assigns lineages using 7-gene MLST. The last update was made in May 14th 2025.

For information about Salmonella Typhi, please see the Typhi dashboard.

.. warning::
    The Salmonella enterica data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts.

Variable definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: justify-text


    - **Genotype** - Pathogenwatch assigns sequence types (STs) using the 7-locus MLST scheme for Salmonella enterica, defined by XX.
    - The genotypes reported here are from the X.
    - Antimicrobial resistance determinants are described in the paper XXXX

Abbreviations

    - 1. MDR, multidrug resistant (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
    - 2. XDR, extensively drug resistant (MDR plus resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone)
    - 3. Ciprofloxacin NS, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC >=0.06 mg/L, due to presence of one or more genes or mutations in *gyrA/parC/gyrB*)
    - 4. Ciprofloxacin R, ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC >=0.5 mg/L, due to presence of multiple mutations and/or genes, see Carey et al, 2023 https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85867)
