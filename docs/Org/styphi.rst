*Salmonella* Typhi
==================
.. container:: justify-text

   *Salmonella* Typhi data in AMRnet are drawn from `Pathogenwatch <http://Pathogen.watch>`__, which calls AMR determinants and `GenoTyphi <https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab414>`_ genotypes from genome assemblies. The *Salmonella* Typhi data in Pathogenwatch are curated by the `Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium <https://www.typhoidgenomics.org>`_, as described `here <https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85867>`_. The prevalence estimates shown are calculated using genome collections derived from non-targeted sampling frames (i.e. surveillance and burden studies, as opposed to AMR focused studies or outbreak investigations) with known year of isolation and country of origin. Last update: 12 November 2024.

   **Variable definitions**

   - **Genotypes**: GenoTyphi scheme, see `Dyson & Holt, 2021 <https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab414>`_.
   - **AMR determinants** are described in the `Typhi Pathogenwatch paper <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23091-2>`_.
   - **Travel-associated cases** are attributed to the country of travel, not the country of isolation, see `Ingle et al, 2019 <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007620>`_.

   **Abbreviations**

   - **MDR**: multidrug resistant (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
   - **XDR**: extensively drug resistant (MDR plus resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone)
   - **Ciprofloxacin NS**: ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC >=0.06 mg/L, due to presence of one or more *qnr* genes or mutations in *gyrA/parC/gyrB*)
   - **Ciprofloxacin R**: ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC >=0.5 mg/L, due to presence of multiple mutations and/or genes)
