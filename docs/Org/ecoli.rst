*Escherichia coli*
===================

.. container:: justify-text

   *Escherichia coli* data in AMRnet are drawn from `Enterobase <https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`__, which calls AMR genotypes using NCBI’s `AMRFinderPlus <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/>`_ and assigns lineages using MLST, `cgMLST <https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.251678.119>`_ and `hierarchical clustering <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab234>`_. Last update: 5 August 2025.

   .. warning::
      The *E. coli* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts which may be skewed towards sequencing AMR strains and/or outbreaks. Data curation efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when interpreting the data in the dashboard.

.. container:: justify-text

   - **Lineages**: Lineages are labeled by 7-locus sequence type (ST).

   - **AMR determinants**: `Enterobase <https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_ identifies AMR determinants using NCBI’s `AMRFinderPlus <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/>`_. AMRnet imports these AMR genotype calls, and assigns them to drugs/classes in the dashboard using the Subclass curated in `refgenes <https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000832>`_. see :ref:`the table <amr-definition-table>`
