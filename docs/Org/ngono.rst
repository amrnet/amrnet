*Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
=======================

.. container:: justify-text

   *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* data are sourced from `Pathogenwatch <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00858-2>`__, which calls AMR and lineage `genotypes <https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/>`_ (`MLST <https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-5-35>`_, `NG-MAST <https://doi.org/10.1086/383047>`_) from genomes assembled from public data. The prevalence estimates shown are calculated using genome collections derived from non-targeted sampling frames (i.e. surveillance and burden studies, as opposed to AMR focused studies or outbreak investigations). These include EuroGASP `2013 <https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(18)30225-1>`_ & `2018 <https://doi.org/10.1016/s2666-5247(22)00044-1>`_, and several national surveillance studies. Last update: 24 January 2024.

Variable definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: justify-text

   - **Genotypes**: sequence types from the `7-locus MLST scheme <https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4178-4182.2005>`_ for **Neisseria**, or 2-locus **N. gonorrhoeae** multi-antigen sequence typing (`NG-MAST <https://doi.org/10.1086/383047>`_) scheme, both hosted by `PubMLST <https://pubmlst.org/neisseria/>`_.
   - **AMR determinants** are identified by Pathogenwatch using an inhouse dictionary developed and maintained in consultation with an expert advisory group, described `here <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00858-2>`__.
   - **AMR determinants within genotypes** - This plot shows combinations of determinants that result in clinical resistance to Azithromycin or Ceftriaxone, as defined in Figure 3 of `Sánchez-Busó et al (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00858-2>`_.
   - **Susceptible to cat I/II drugs** - No determinants found for Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, Cefixime (category I) or Benzylpenicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Spectinomycin (category II).

   - **MDR**: multidrug resistant (Resistant to one of Azithromycin / Ceftriaxone / Cefixime [category I representatives], plus two or more of Benzylpenicillin / Ciprofloxacin / Spectinomycin [category II representatives])
   - **XDR**: extensively drug resistant (Resistant to two of Azithromycin / Ceftriaxone / Cefixime [category I representatives], plus three of Benzylpenicillin / Ciprofloxacin / Spectinomycin [category II representatives])

   .. note::

      These definitions are based on those defined in the `European CDC Response Plan <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/multi-and-extensively-drug-resistant-gonorrhoea-response-plan-Europe-2019.pdf>`_, modified to use the specific representatives of category I and II antibiotic classes that are available in the dashboard.
