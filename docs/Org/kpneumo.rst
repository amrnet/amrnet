*Klebsiella pneumoniae*
=======================
.. container:: justify-text

    *Klebsiella pneumoniae* data are sourced from `Pathogenwatch <https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab784>`__, which calls AMR (using `Kleborate <https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kleborate>`_) and genotypes (`MLST <https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4178-4182.2005>`__) from genomes assembled from public data. Last update: 24 May 2025.

    .. warning:: The *Klebsiella pneumoniae* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts which have been largely directed at sequencing ESBL and carbapenemase-producing strains or hypervirulent strains. Data curation efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when interpreting the data in the dashboard.

Variable definitions

.. container:: justify-text

    - **Genotypes**: `7-locus MLST scheme <https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4178-4182.2005>`_ for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and sublineages (defined from core-genome MLST, as described `here <https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac135>`__), maintained by `Institut Pasteur <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/>`_.
    - **AMR determinants** are called using `Kleborate v3 <https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kleborate>`_, described `here <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24448-3>`__. Fluoroquinolone resistance is defined as presence of an acquired qnr/qep gene OR a mutation in the quinolone-resistance determining regions of gyrA or parC.
    - **No acquired resistance**: no resistance determinants identified besides a wildtype beta-lactamase SHV allele associated with intrinsic resistance to ampicillin (i.e. not an ESBL or inhibitor-resistant variant of SHV, see `Tsang et al 2024 <https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.001294>`_.

Abbreviations
