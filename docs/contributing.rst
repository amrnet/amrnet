Initial Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. container:: justify-text

   .. code-block:: shell

      # Clone your fork
      git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/amrnet.git
      cd amrnet

      # Install dependencies
      npm install
      cd client && npm install && cd ..

      # Set up environment
      cp .env.example .env
      # Edit .env with your configuration

Code Quality Standards
----------------------

Linting and Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. container:: justify-text

   AMRnet uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality:

   .. code-block:: shell

      # Lint JavaScript/React code
      cd client && npm run lint

      # Format code with Prettier
      npm run format

      # Fix linting issues automatically
      cd client && npm run lint:fix

Testing
~~~~~~~
.. container:: justify-text

   Always include tests with your contributions:

   .. code-block:: shell

      # Run frontend tests
      cd client && npm test

      # Run tests with coverage
      cd client && npm test -- --coverage

      # Run backend tests (if available)
      npm run test:backend

Git Hooks
~~~~~~~~~
.. container:: justify-text

   Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting and formatting:
   - Configured via ``.editorconfig`` and ``.prettierrc.json``
   - Ensures consistent code style across all contributions
