*Klebsiella pneumoniae*
=======================
.. container:: justify-text

    *Klebsiella pneumoniae* data are sourced from `Pathogenwatch <https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab784>`__, which calls AMR (using `Kleborate <https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kleborate>`_) and genotypes (`MLST <https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4178-4182.2005>`__) from genomes assembled from public data. Last update: 5 August 2025.

    .. warning:: The *Klebsiella pneumoniae* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts which have been largely directed at sequencing ESBL and carbapenemase-producing strains or hypervirulent strains. Data curation efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when interpreting the data in the dashboard.

    - **Genotypes** 

      - ST: sequence type, defined by the `7-locus MLST scheme <https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.43.8.4178-4182.2005>`_ for *Klebsiella pneumoniae* species complex
      - cgST: core genome sequence type, defined by the `core genome MLST scheme <https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2011.140206>`_, maintained by `Institut Pasteur <https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/>`_
      - Sublineage: defined from core-genome MLST, as described `here <https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac135>`_

    - **AMR determinants** are called using `Kleborate v3 <https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kleborate>`_, described `here <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24448-3>`__. Ciprofloxacin resistance is defined based on the prediction generated by Kleborate. For all other drugs, resistance is defined by the presence of one or more markers in the corresponding Kleborate output column.
    - **Pansusceptible**: no resistance determinants identified besides a wildtype beta-lactamase SHV allele associated with intrinsic resistance to ampicillin (i.e. not an ESBL or inhibitor-resistant variant of SHV, see `Tsang et al 2024 <https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.001294>`_.

Abbreviations
