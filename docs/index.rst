Overview
========

**AMRnet** aims to make high-quality, robust and reliable genome-derived
AMR Surveillance data accessible to a wide audience. Visualizations
are geared towards showing national annual AMR prevalence estimates
and trends, that can be broken down and explored in terms of underlying
genotypes and resistance mechanisms. We do not generate sequence data,
but we hope that by making publicly deposited data more accessible and
useful, we can encourage and motivate more sequencing and data sharing.
