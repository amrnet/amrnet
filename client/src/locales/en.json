    "paragraph1": "The AMRnet dashboard aims to make high-quality, robust and reliable genome-derived AMR surveillance data accessible to a wide audience. Visualisations are geared towards showing national annual AMR prevalence estimates and trends over time, which can be broken down and explored in terms of underlying genotypes and resistance mechanisms. We do not generate sequence data, but we hope that by making publicly deposited data more accessible and useful, we can encourage and motivate more sequencing and data sharing.",

This kind of curation can benefit a wide range of users and we plan to work with additional organism-specific communities to curate data, and to contribute to wider efforts around metadata standards.
