"The *Shigella* + EIEC data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for "
"purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global "
"sequencing efforts which may be skewed towards sequencing AMR strains "
"and/or outbreaks. Data curation efforts are ongoing however until then, "
"please be careful when interpreting the data in the dashboard."
