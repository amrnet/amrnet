"*Escherichia coli* data in AMRnet are drawn from `Enterobase "
"<https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`__, which calls AMR genotypes using "
"NCBI’s `AMRFinderPlus <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens"

"The *E. coli* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-"
"sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts "
"which may be skewed towards sequencing AMR strains and/or outbreaks. Data"
" curation efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when "
"interpreting the data in the dashboard."
