"The *Klebsiella pneumoniae* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for "
"purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global "
"sequencing efforts which have been largely directed at sequencing ESBL "
"and carbapenemase-producing strains or hypervirulent strains. Data "
"curation efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when "
"interpreting the data in the dashboard."
