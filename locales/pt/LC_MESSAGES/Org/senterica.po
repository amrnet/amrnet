"Nontyphoidal *Salmonella* data in AMRnet are drawn from `Enterobase "
"<https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_, which calls AMR genotypes using "
"NCBI’s `AMRFinderPlus <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens"
"/antimicrobial-resistance/AMRFinder/>`_, assigns lineages using MLST, "
"`cgMLST <https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.251678.119>`_ and `hierarchical "
"clustering <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab234>`_, and "
"assigns serotypes using `SISTR "
"<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147101>`_. The *Salmonella* (non-"
"typhoidal) dashboard includes all genomes classified as *S. enterica* "
"subsp. *enterica* (based on hierarchical clustering level 2850, `HC2850=2"
" <https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0240>`_), and excluding all genomes "
"with predicted serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A/B/C. Last update: 5 August "

"The non-typhoidal *Salmonella* data used in AMRnet are not yet curated "
"for purpose-of-sampling, and therefore reflect the biases of global "
"sequencing efforts which may be skewed towards sequencing AMR strains "
"and/or outbreaks. Data curation efforts are ongoing however until then, "
"please be careful when interpreting the data in the dashboard."
