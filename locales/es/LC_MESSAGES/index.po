"The `AMRnet dashboard <https://www.amrnet.org/>`_ aims to make high-"
"quality, robust and reliable genome-derived AMR surveillance data "
"accessible to a wide audience. Visualizations are geared towards showing "
"national annual AMR prevalence estimates and trends, that can be broken "
"down and explored in terms of underlying lineages/genotypes and "
"resistance mechanisms. We do not generate sequence data, but we hope that"
" by making publicly deposited data more accessible and useful, we can "
"encourage and motivate more sequencing and data sharing."

"We started with *Salmonella* Typhi, based on our `TyphiNET "
"<https://www.typhi.net>`_ dashboard which uses data curated by the "
"`Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium <http://typhoidgenomics.org>`_ (to "
"improve data quality and identify which datasets are suitable for "
"inclusion) and analysed in `Pathogenwatch <http://pathogen.watch>`_ (to "
"call AMR determinants and lineages from sequence data). Dashboards are "
"now available for *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, non-"
"typhoidal *Salmonella*, *E. coli* and *Shigella* using data sourced from "
"the `Pathogenwatch <http://pathogen.watch>`_ and `Enterobase "
"<https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_ platforms. In the future, we plan "
"to add additional organisms, sourced from these and other platforms."

"A major barrier to using public data for surveillance is the need for "
"careful data curation, to identify which datasets are relevant for "
"inclusion in pooled estimates of AMR and genotype prevalence. This kind "
"of curation can benefit a wide range of users and we plan to work with "
"other organism communities to curate data, and to contribute to wider "
"efforts around metadata standards. Please get in touch if you would like "
"to work with us (`amrnetdashboard@gmail.com "
"<amrnetdashboard@gmail.com>`_)."
