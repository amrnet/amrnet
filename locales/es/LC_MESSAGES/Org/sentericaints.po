"*Salmonella* (invasive non-typhoidal) data in AMRnet are drawn from "
"`Enterobase <https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/>`_, which calls AMR "
"genotypes using NCBI’s `AMRFinderPlus "
"<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-"
"resistance/AMRFinder/>`_, assigns lineages using MLST, `cgMLST "
"<https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.251678.119>`_ and `hierarchical clustering "
"<https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab234>`_, and assigns serotypes"
" using `SISTR <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147101>`_. The iNTS "
"dashboard currently includes all genomes identified as serotype "
"Typhimurium or Enteritidis (which account for `>90% of iNTS "
"<https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00615-0>`_), and identifies "
"lineages thereof using MLST. Last update: 5 August 2025."

"The invasive non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (iNTS) dashboard is populated "
"with data from specific *Salmonella enterica* lineages that are "
"associated with invasive disease in low-income countries; namely serotype"
" Typhimurium (ST19, ST313 and sublineages thereof as defined by `Van "
"Puyvelde et al <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41152-6>`_) and "
"Enteritidis (Central/Eastern and West African clades as defined by `Fong "
"et al <https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.001017>`_). Together these account "
"for `>90% of iNTS <https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00615-0>`_."

"The iNTS data used in AMRnet are not yet curated for purpose-of-sampling,"
" and therefore reflect the biases of global sequencing efforts which may "
"be skewed towards sequencing AMR strains and/or outbreaks. Data curation "
"efforts are ongoing however until then, please be careful when "
"interpreting the data in the dashboard."
