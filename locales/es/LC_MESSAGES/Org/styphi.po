"The AMRnet project is based on the TyphiNET dashboard, available at "
"`https://www.typhi.net/ <https://www.typhi.net/>`_ and described in the "
"paper: `Dyson et al, Genome Medicine 2025 "
"<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-025-01470-4>`_. The TyphiNET dashboard "
"includes some different visualisations to AMRnet, and is maintained in "
"the form described in the TyphiNET paper, in parallel to AMRnet and "
"populated with the same underlying data as curated by the GTGC. Notably, "
"`TyphiNET <https://www.typhi.net/>`_ has the additional feature of "
"plotting combinations of AMR markers (for a single drug/class), per "
"genotype."
