### Duration: 8-10 minutes

## Script Outline

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)
**[Screen: AMRnet homepage]**

"Welcome to this tutorial on the new internationalization features in AMRnet. I'm going to show you how to use the multi-language support that now allows you to access the AMRnet dashboard in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, complete with country flags for easy identification."

### Part 1: Introduction to Language Switcher (0:30 - 1:30)
**[Screen: Close-up of header with language switcher]**

"The language switcher is located in the top-right corner of the header. You'll see a small flag icon with a two-letter language code - this indicates your current language. By default, AMRnet starts in English, but it can automatically detect your browser's language preference."

**[Action: Hover over language switcher]**

"When you hover over the language switcher, you'll see it's interactive. Let's click on it to see all available languages."

### Part 2: Available Languages (1:30 - 2:30)
**[Screen: Language dropdown menu open]**

"The dropdown shows four language options:
- English with the United States flag
- Français with the French flag
- Português (BR) with the Brazilian flag
- Español with the Spanish flag

Each option displays both the country flag and the language name in that language, making it easy to identify your preferred language even if you don't read the text."

### Part 3: Switching to French (2:30 - 3:30)
**[Action: Click on French option]**

"Let's select French first. Notice how the interface immediately updates - the navigation menu now shows 'Accueil' instead of 'Home', 'À Propos' instead of 'About', and so on. The language switcher icon also updates to show the French flag."

**[Action: Navigate through different pages]**

"As we navigate to different sections, you can see that all the text elements are translated, including buttons, form labels, and page titles. The translations are professional and culturally appropriate for French-speaking users."

### Part 4: Portuguese (Brazil) Translation (3:30 - 4:30)
**[Action: Switch to Portuguese]**

"Now let's try Portuguese. I'll click the language switcher again and select 'Português (BR)'. Notice the Brazilian flag - this indicates Brazilian Portuguese specifically, which has some differences from European Portuguese."

**[Action: Show dashboard features in Portuguese]**

"The dashboard title is now 'Painel de Controle', and all the interface elements are translated appropriately. You can see 'Início' for Home, 'Sobre' for About, and 'Contato' for Contact."

### Part 5: Spanish Translation (4:30 - 5:30)
**[Action: Switch to Spanish]**

"Finally, let's look at the Spanish translation. Selecting 'Español' updates everything to Spanish - 'Inicio' for Home, 'Panel' for Dashboard, and so on. The translations use standard international Spanish that should be understandable across different Spanish-speaking regions."

### Part 6: Language Persistence (5:30 - 6:30)
**[Action: Refresh the page]**

"One important feature is language persistence. Watch what happens when I refresh the page - the language selection is remembered! This is because your language preference is stored locally in your browser."

**[Action: Open new tab/window]**

"Even if I open a new tab or window, the language preference carries over. This ensures a consistent experience throughout your AMRnet session."

### Part 7: Mobile Responsiveness (6:30 - 7:30)
**[Action: Show mobile view or resize browser]**

"The language switcher is also fully responsive. On smaller screens, it adapts gracefully while maintaining all functionality. The flags remain clearly visible, and the dropdown menu adjusts to the screen size."

**[Action: Demonstrate on different screen sizes]**

"Whether you're using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the language switching experience remains smooth and intuitive."

### Part 8: Technical Benefits (7:30 - 8:30)
**[Screen: Back to desktop view, showing Dashboard with data]**

"From a technical standpoint, this internationalization system:
- Loads quickly without affecting performance
- Maintains all functionality across languages
- Preserves data and filter selections when switching languages
- Follows accessibility best practices for screen readers
- Uses professional, culturally-appropriate translations"

### Closing (8:30 - 9:00)
**[Screen: AMRnet homepage in English]**

"This multi-language support makes AMRnet more accessible to researchers and public health professionals worldwide. Whether you're more comfortable working in French, Portuguese, Spanish, or English, you can now use AMRnet in your preferred language."
