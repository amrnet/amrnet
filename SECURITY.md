# 🔐 Security Policy

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of AMRnet seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the responsible disclosure process:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: [amrnetdashboard@gmail.com](mailto:amrnetdashboard@gmail.com )

Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline for fix
- **30 days**: Target resolution for critical vulnerabilities

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Main AMRnet application ([https://amrnet.org](https://amrnet.org))
- API endpoints and services
- Related infrastructure and services

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             |

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Environment Variables Security

**NEVER commit `.env` files with real credentials to git!**

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual credentials
# MongoDB connection string, API keys, etc.

# Verify .env files are ignored
git status  # Should NOT show .env files
```

#### Secure Development Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Sanitize data before database operations

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Follow principle of least privilege

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Regularly audit for known vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` and `pip check`

4. **Code Review**
   - All code changes require review
   - Security-focused review for sensitive changes
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD

### For Deployment

#### MongoDB Security

1. **Database Access Control**
   - Create dedicated users with minimal permissions
   - Use environment-specific clusters (dev/staging/prod)
   - Enable IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Connection Security**
   - Use encrypted connections (TLS/SSL)
   - Implement connection pooling limits
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns

#### Application Security

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use different credentials for each environment
   - Implement proper secret management
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

2. **Network Security**
   - Configure proper CORS policies
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Exposed

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
   - Check access logs for unauthorized activity
   - Update all environments with new credentials

2. **Git History Cleanup**

   ```bash
   # Remove sensitive files from git history
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env*' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

3. **Post-Incident**
   - Document the incident
   - Review and improve security processes
   - Notify affected stakeholders if necessary

### Security Incident Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Data breach, system compromise | 1 hour |
| **High** | Service disruption, privilege escalation | 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Security misconfiguration, DOS | 24 hours |
| **Low** | Minor security issues | 72 hours |

## 🔧 Security Tools and Monitoring

### Automated Security Scanning

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
